# 🚀 Share Your Environmental Analysis

Great job finishing the Python tutorial! Now let's put your work on a real website where others can see it.

## 🤔 What You'll Do

1. **Get your own copy** of this project to work on
2. **Create your environmental analysis** using a template  
3. **See it working** on your computer
4. **Share it** with the world through the website

**Think of it like:** You're adding a new page to a shared environmental magazine!

## 🛠️ What You Need

- ✅ **Finished the Python tutorial** (you can make charts!)
- ✅ **GitHub account** (free at [github.com](https://github.com)) 
- ✅ **About 30-60 minutes** of time

**Haven't learned Python yet?** Go back to the [Python tutorial](../python-tutorial/README.md) first!

## 🚀 Let's Do This Step by Step

### Step 1: Get Git (5 minutes)

**Git is like "save" for your code** - it keeps track of changes and helps you share your work.

**Install Git:**
- **Windows:** Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com) and install
- **Mac:** Type `git --version` in Terminal (will install if needed)  
- **Linux:** Type `sudo apt install git`

**Test it:** Open your terminal and type `git --version`
You should see something like "git version 2.39"

### Step 2: Get Your Own Copy (5 minutes)

**Make your own copy to work on:**

1. **Go to this project on GitHub** (where you found this tutorial)
2. **Click the "Fork" button** (top right of the page)
3. **Click "Create fork"**

🎉 **Now you have your own copy!** You can make changes without affecting the original.

### Step 3: Download to Your Computer (10 minutes)

**Learn how to clone repositories:**
- [Cloning a Repository (GitHub)](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
- [Git Clone Command](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone)

**Your goal:** Download your forked repository to your computer using `git clone`

### Step 4: Set Up the Website (15 minutes)

**Learn about Node.js and web development:**
- [What is Node.js?](https://nodejs.org/en/about/)
- [npm Tutorial](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started)
- [Local Development Environment](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/set_up_a_local_testing_server)

**Your goal:** 
1. Install Node.js on your computer
2. Use npm to install the website dependencies  
3. Start the local development server

### Step 5: Add Your Analysis to the Website

**📋 Complete Task Guide:** [Adding Your Content](docs/adding_your_content.md)

This comprehensive guide covers:
- Understanding how the website structure works
- Creating your analysis folder in the content system
- Making an HTML page to display your results
- Updating the website configuration to include your analysis
- Testing everything works locally before submission
- Troubleshooting common integration issues
