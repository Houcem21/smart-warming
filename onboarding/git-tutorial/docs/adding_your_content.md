# Adding Your Analysis to the Website

This guide shows you exactly how to take your Python analysis and make it appear on the live website. You'll learn how the website works and how to integrate your analysis.

## Understanding the Website Structure

The Smart Warming website is organized like this:
- **Homepage** - Welcome page with Games|Articles navigation
- **Articles page** - Lists all data analyses 
- **Individual article pages** - Your analysis with charts and data
- **Content map** - Configuration file that tells the website what content exists

## Step 1: Explore the Existing Example

**Look at the pigeon analysis** to understand how everything fits together:

1. **Go to `content/articles/pigeon-analysis/`**
2. **Open each file and read through it:**
   - `analyze_data.py` - The Python analysis script
   - `web-analysis.html` - The webpage that displays results
   - `output/analysis_data.json` - The data in website format
   - `README.md` - Documentation about the analysis

**Notice how they connect:**
- Python script generates data ‚Üí JSON file
- HTML page loads JSON data ‚Üí Creates interactive charts
- Content map registers the analysis ‚Üí Website can find it

## Step 2: Create Your Analysis Folder

**Set up your analysis in the content system:**

1. **Go to `content/articles/`**
2. **Create a new folder** with your analysis name (use dashes, no spaces):
   - Good: `climate-temperature-trends`
   - Good: `air-quality-major-cities` 
   - Bad: `my analysis` or `My Analysis`

3. **Copy files from your demo folder:**
   - Your `my_analysis.py` ‚Üí rename to `analyze_data.py`
   - Your chart PNG file ‚Üí move to `output/` folder
   - Your JSON data file ‚Üí move to `output/` as `analysis_data.json`

## Step 3: Create Your Web Page

**Make an HTML page to display your analysis:**

1. **Copy `pigeon-analysis/web-analysis.html`** to your folder
2. **Rename it** to `web-analysis.html` (keep this exact name)
3. **Edit the content** to match your analysis:

### Key Sections to Update:

**Page Title and Description:**
- Change the `<title>` tag
- Update the main heading `<h1>`
- Modify the description paragraph

**Embedded Data Section:**
- Find the `ANALYSIS_DATA` variable in the JavaScript
- Replace it with your JSON data structure
- Make sure the format matches exactly

**Content Sections:**
- Update "Executive Summary" with your findings
- Modify "Key Findings" to reflect your results
- Change "Methodology" to describe your approach
- Update "Future Research Directions" with related ideas

**Navigation Header:**
- Update the title to match your analysis
- Keep the back links to articles page

### Example Updates:
```html
<!-- Change this -->
<title>Pigeon Environmental Analysis</title>
<h1>üê¶ Pigeon Environmental Impact Analysis</h1>

<!-- To this -->
<title>Climate Temperature Trends</title>
<h1>üå°Ô∏è Global Temperature Change Analysis</h1>
```

## Step 4: Update the Content Map

**Tell the website about your new analysis:**

1. **Open `webapp/public/content-map.json`**
2. **Find the `"articles"` section**
3. **Add your analysis entry:**

```json
{
  "articles": {
    "pigeon-analysis": {
      "title": "Pigeon Environmental Analysis",
      "description": "Analysis of pigeon impact on urban infrastructure. No installation required!",
      "path": "../content/articles/pigeon-analysis/",
      "file": "web-analysis.html",
      "linkedGames": ["pigeon-tracker"]
    },
    "your-analysis-name": {
      "title": "Your Analysis Title",
      "description": "Brief description of what you analyzed. No installation required!",
      "path": "../content/articles/your-analysis-name/",
      "file": "web-analysis.html",
      "linkedGames": []
    }
  }
}
```

**Make sure to:**
- Use the exact same folder name as your analysis folder
- Write a compelling title and description
- Keep the file name as `web-analysis.html`
- Leave `linkedGames` as empty array `[]` for now

## Step 5: Test Your Integration Locally

**Start the development server:**

1. **Open terminal in the `webapp` folder**
2. **Run `npm install`** (first time only)
3. **Run `npm run dev`**
4. **Open your browser** to the URL shown (usually `http://localhost:5173`)

**Test the complete flow:**
1. **Homepage loads** with Games|Articles header
2. **Click "Articles"** - you should see your analysis listed
3. **Click your analysis** - your page should load with charts
4. **Check everything works:**
   - Charts display correctly
   - Data loads without errors
   - Navigation links work
   - Page looks professional

### Common Issues and Fixes:

**"Analysis not showing in list":**
- Check `content-map.json` syntax is valid
- Verify folder name matches exactly
- Make sure there are no extra commas

**"Page loads but no charts":**
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors (F12)
- Verify your JSON data format is correct
- Make sure `analysis_data.json` exists in output folder

**"Charts show but wrong data":**
- Check the embedded `ANALYSIS_DATA` variable in your HTML
- Verify it matches your JSON file structure
- Update the chart titles and labels

**"Styling looks wrong":**
- Make sure you copied the CSS styles correctly
- Check that your HTML structure matches the example
- Verify all chart containers have correct IDs

## Step 6: Add Documentation

**Create a README for your analysis:**

Create `README.md` in your analysis folder:

```markdown
# Your Analysis Title

Brief description of what environmental issue you analyzed.

## Data Source

Explain where you got your data from and any limitations.

## Methodology

Describe how you processed and analyzed the data.

## Key Findings

Summarize the most important discoveries from your analysis.

## Files

- `analyze_data.py` - Python script that processes the data
- `web-analysis.html` - Web page displaying results
- `output/analysis_data.json` - Processed data for web display
- `output/chart.png` - Chart image file
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies needed

## Running the Analysis

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python analyze_data.py
```

## Future Work
