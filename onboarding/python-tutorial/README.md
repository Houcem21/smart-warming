# Learn Python & Build a CO2 Demo 📊

Hello! You're going to learn Python by building something cool - a chart that shows real environmental data.

**Don't worry if you've never coded before.** We'll go step by step.

## 🎯 What You'll Build

A Python program that:
1. Gets real CO2 data from the internet
2. Makes a chart
3. Saves files for the website to use

## 📁 Your Workspace

You'll work in the demo folder where everything is ready:
```
data-analysis/
├── demo/               # Work in here
│   ├── my_demo.py      # Your Python code goes here
│   ├── output/         # Your results go here (already created)
│   │   ├── co2_data.json   # Data file (you'll create this)
│   │   └── my_chart.png    # Picture of your chart (you'll create this)
│   └── my_notes.md     # Write what you learned
├── docs/               # Learning resources
└── requirements.txt    # Python packages needed
```

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Tutorial

### Step 1: Set Up Python (15 minutes)
1. **Install Python** - Go to [python.org](https://python.org) and download Python
2. **Test it works** - Open terminal/command prompt and type: `python --version`
3. **Install helpers** - Type: `pip install requests matplotlib pandas`

**Stuck?** → Read [How to Install Python](docs/install_python.md)

### Step 2: Go to Your Demo Workspace (5 minutes)
1. **Open the demo folder** in VS Code or any text editor
2. **Create a new file** called `my_demo.py` inside the demo folder
3. **Create a new file** called `my_notes.md` inside the demo folder
4. The `output` folder is already there and ready!

**Never used a text editor?** Search "how to use VS Code" or use any text editor you like

### Step 3: Write Your First Python Code (30 minutes)
1. **Start simple** - Make Python say hello
2. **Get data from internet** - Learn to fetch CO2 information  
3. **Make a chart** - Turn numbers into a picture
4. **Save your work** - Put files in the output folder

**Never written code?** → Follow [Python for Complete Beginners](docs/python_basics.md)

### Step 4: Test Everything Works (10 minutes)
1. **Open terminal in the demo folder** - Navigate to the demo directory
2. **Run your code** - Type: `python my_demo.py`
3. **Check your output folder** - Should have 2 new files
4. **Look at your chart** - Open the PNG file
5. **Write what you learned** - Update your notes file

**Getting errors?** → Check [Common Problems & Solutions](docs/common_errors.md)

## ✅ You're Done When:
- [ ] Your Python code runs without red error messages
- [ ] You have a PNG file with a chart
- [ ] You have a JSON file with data
- [ ] You wrote notes about what you learned

## 🆘 Need Help?

## 🎉 What Happens Next?

When you finish:
1. **Your chart** shows up on the project website
2. **Your data** feeds into the environmental games
3. **You learned Python!** - You can build more cool stuff

## 🌟 Challenges (Optional)
