# Your First Environmental Analysis

You're going to make your first chart with real environmental data! Think of it like making a graph for a school project, but with Python instead of pencil and paper.

## What is Python?

Python is a way to tell computers what to do using simple English-like words. It's really good at working with numbers and making charts.

## What You'll Make Today

A simple chart showing environmental data - like temperature changes or energy use. You'll:
1. Get real data from the internet (we'll show you how!)
2. Make a pretty chart  
3. Save it as a picture you can share

## Your Workspace

You have a `demo` folder to work in. Think of it like your desk where you'll keep all your work organized.

## Let's Start Simple

### Step 1: Get Python Ready (10 minutes)

**Install Python:**
1. Go to [python.org](https://python.org) 
2. Download Python (the big green button)
3. Install it (click "Next" on everything)

**Test it works:**
- Open Command Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac/Linux)  
- Type: `python --version`
- You should see something like "Python 3.11"

**Get the tools we need:**
- Type: `pip install matplotlib pandas requests`
- This gets us tools for making charts and getting data

*Stuck? Don't worry! Check the [install help](docs/install_python.md)*
