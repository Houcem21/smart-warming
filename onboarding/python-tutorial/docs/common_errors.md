   - Full error message
   - What you were trying to do

## Debugging Tips

**Print everything to see what's happening:**
- Add print statements at each step
- Check response codes from APIs
- Print your data to see what you received

**Check if files are being created:**
- List what's in your output folder
- Verify file paths are correct
