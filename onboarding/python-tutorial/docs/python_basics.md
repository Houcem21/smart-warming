# Python for Complete Beginners üêç

Welcome! Let's build your CO2 demo step by step.

## Step 1: Your First Python Code (5 minutes)

1. Go to the demo folder
2. Create a file called `my_demo.py` in the demo folder
3. Type a print statement to say hello
4. Open terminal in demo folder and run: `python my_demo.py`
5. You should see your message appear

**Learn how:** Search "Python print statement" or ask for help

## Step 2: Get Data from the Internet (15 minutes)

1. Learn about the `import` statement to get tools
2. Use the `requests` library to fetch data
3. Get data from: `https://api.carbonintensity.org.uk/intensity`
4. Convert the response to JSON format
5. Print the CO2 level to see if it worked

**Learn how:** Read [What is an API?](what_is_api.md) first

## Step 3: Make a Chart (15 minutes)

1. Import matplotlib for making charts
2. Extract the CO2 number from your data
3. Create a bar chart with the CO2 level
4. Add a title and labels to your chart
5. Save the chart as a PNG file to the output folder

**Learn how:** Search "matplotlib bar chart tutorial" 

## Step 4: Save Data File (10 minutes)

1. Import json and os libraries
2. Save your raw data as a JSON file (output folder already exists)
3. Add print statements to confirm everything worked

**Learn how:** Search "Python save JSON file"

## Test Your Demo

1. Save your file in the demo folder
2. Open terminal in the demo folder
3. Run: `python my_demo.py`
4. Check the output folder - should have 2 new files!
